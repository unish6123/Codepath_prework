# Prework - *Background Changer*

Submitted by: **Unish Aryal**

**First Project** is an app that changes its background color and also changes the label's content when Click here is clicked. [TODO] 

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Following are the features I liked from the other applications.
Study with me app
- [ ] I liked the font style, color, and music functionality
- [ ] I liked the icon used in there like settings , restart and so on.

Pomodoro Timer
- [ ] I like the graphical representation of time spent on different activities.
- [ ] I liked the options of relaxing music in relaxation section.

Gmail
- [ ] Help us to differentiate email by having features like starred.
- [ ] Can be saved as a draft to continue later.


I'm considering creating a Pomodoro timer that simplifies the process by allowing users to set a 25-minute timer for focused study sessions and customize timers for various activities. The timer could include features like a relaxation timer with adjustable durations, accompanied by soothing sounds such as rainfall or a crackling fireplace. I plan to incorporate different timer types tailored to specific activities.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- There were not many challenges. However, it was bit overwhelming to see lot of thing on display on xcode.
